- 🚀 [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) for the frontend.
    - 💃 Using [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/).
- 🐋 [Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com) for development and production.
- 🔒 Secure password hashing by default.
- 🔑 JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication.
- ✅ Tests with [Pytest](https://pytest.org).
- 📞 [Traefik](https://traefik.io) as a reverse proxy / load balancer.
- 🚢 Deployment instructions using Docker Compose, including how to set up a frontend Traefik proxy to handle automatic HTTPS certificates.
- 🏭 CI (continuous integration) and CD (continuous deployment) based on GitHub Actions.

## How To Use It

Clone the repository and follow the instructions below.

### Configure

You can then update configs in the `.env` files to customize your configurations.

Before deploying it, make sure you change at least the values for:

- `AUTH_SECRET`
- `AUTH_TRUST_HOST`
- `AUTH_URL`
- `API_SERVER`

You can (and should) pass these as environment variables from secrets.

Read the [deployment.md](./deployment.md) docs for more details.

### Generate Secret Keys

Some environment variables in the `.env` file have a default value of `changethis`.

You have to change them with a secret key, to generate secret keys you can run the following command:

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

Copy the content and use that as password / secret key. And run that again to generate another secure key.
