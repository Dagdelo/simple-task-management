## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository and install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth-example.git
cd next-auth-example
npm install
```

### 2. Configure your local environment

Copy the .env.local.example file in this directory to .env.local (which will be ignored by Git):

```
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Add details for one or more providers (e.g. Google, Twitter, GitHub, Email, etc).

#### Database

A database is needed to persist user accounts and to support email sign in. However, you can still use NextAuth.js for authentication without a database by using OAuth for authentication. If you do not specify a database, [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/introduction) will be enabled by default.

You **can** skip configuring a database and come back to it later if you want.

For more information about setting up a database, please check out the following links:
